#| Question 1: Using *** to show the changes I made in Comments |#

#| Question 2

The Lazy evaluation will result in a different semantics in some special cases
Since we have static scoping and dynamic scoping, the lazy evaluation will not effect our static scoping which is our enviornment.
However, it does effect the dynamic scoping which is our heap.
Therefore, if our program contains some expression which will update the heap and those expression might not be evaluated since we are using lazy evaluation,
Our semantics will be different with homework5.

The idea of the lazy evaluation is that we store the Expr for the variable directly in the env, like (x (+ 1 1)), instead of storing (x 2) in env, we store (x (+ 1 1)) in env.
When we want to use this variable, say x, in the later expression, we evaluate the Expr which belongs to this variable, which is (+ 1 1).

1.
When CondExpr (and, or) if the first conditions false (and) / true (or) the rest of the condiitons will not be evaluated.
If the rest of the condiitons contain any expression that will make changes to heap, those changes will not be evaluated and it will effect the semantics of the program.

Example 1:
(define test1
  '((and (gt 1 2) (lt (var ((x (ref 10))) x) 2))
1
(deref 1)
))
if we do (eval test1 '() '((1 free))) in our original one for homework5, it will result '(10 ((1 10)))
However, if we use lazy evaluation, the (lt (var ((x (ref 10))) x) 2) part will not be evaluated since (gt 1 2) is false and it's enough for 'and'
So the result will be '((exception fma) ((1 free)))

Exanmple 2:
(define test2
  '((or (gt 2 1) (lt (var ((x (ref 10))) x) 2))
(deref 1)
1
))
if we do (eval test2 '() '((1 free))) in our original one for homework5, it will result '(10 ((1 10)))
However, if we use lazy evaluation, the (lt (var ((x (ref 10))) x) 2) part will not be evaluated since (gt 2 1) is true and it's enough for 'or'
So the result will be '((exception fma) ((1 free)))

2.
Since we have changed all evaluation for VarExpr to lazy evaluation, if there is a varassign which will make change to heap such as (x (ref 10))
but this varassign is not evaluated in the later expressions, then the change will never be evaluated and it will effect the semantics of the program.

Example 1:
(define test3
  '(var ((x (ref 10)) (y 1)) (+ y (deref 1))))
if we do (eval test3 '() '((1 free))) in our original one for homework5, it will result '(11 ((1 10)))
However, if we use lazy evaluation, the (x (ref 10) part will not be evaluated since x is not called in the later expression, so the result will be '((exception fma) ((1 free)))

Moreover, if we have ( (x (ref 1)) (y (ref 5)) ) as our varassignseq, ((1 free) (2 free)) and y evaluate before x, then the heap will be ((1 5) (2 1)) instead of ((1 2) (2 5))
And this will effect our semantics.

3.
Same with VarExpr, we will have different semantics for evaluating ApplyF.
Since we use VarExpr to evaluate ApplyF, those args might not be evaluated if they are not called in the later expression. Then the result will be different.

Example 1:
(define test4
  '(fun ((f (x y z)) ((gt z y) x (deref 1)))
(apply (f ((ref 2) (+ 4 4) (+ 0 1))))))
if we do (eval test4 '() '((1 free))) in our original one for homework5, it will result '(2 ((1 2)))
However, if we use lazy evaluation, the (ref 2) part will not be evaluated since x is not called in the later expression, so the result will be '((exception fma) ((1 free)))

|#

(define test4
  '(fun ((f (x y z)) ((gt z y) x (deref 1)))
(apply (f ((ref 2) (+ 4 4) (+ 0 1))))))
